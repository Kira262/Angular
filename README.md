## üöÄ Getting Started

To run any project:
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the desired project folder (e.g., <code>cd 1-EasyTask</code>).
2. Install dependencies:
   <pre>npm install</pre>
3. Start the development server:
   <pre>npm start</pre>
   or
   <pre>ng serve</pre>
4. Open your browser to <code>http://localhost:4200</code> (or the port shown in the terminal).

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure & Adding New Projects

- Each numbered folder (e.g., <code>1-EasyTask</code>, <code>2-InvestmentCalculator</code>) is a standalone Angular project.
- Shared resources, if any, are in <code>other-resources/</code>.

To add a new project:
1. Create a new folder in the root directory (e.g., <code>10-YourProjectName</code>).
2. Scaffold a new Angular project inside that folder using Angular CLI:
   <pre>ng new 10-YourProjectName --directory ./10-YourProjectName</pre>
3. Follow the same structure and naming conventions as the other projects.
4. Add your project to the main README table for visibility.

Example structure:
```
Angular/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1-EasyTask/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2-InvestmentCalculator/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ other-resources/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CONTRIBUTING.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

## Troubleshooting / FAQ

- **Port already in use?** Stop any running Angular servers or use a different port: <pre>ng serve --port 4300</pre>
- **Dependency issues?** Delete <code>node_modules</code> and <code>package-lock.json</code>, then run <pre>npm install</pre> again.
- **Other issues?** Check the project-specific README or open an issue.
